Hi everyone
I will be recording my progress as a data analyst over the next 4 months as part of a 120 day challenge
Today i will be reviewing data analyst jobs in order to find out which skills are most relevant in the data analyst workspace
I am an entry level job aspirant with a bachelor's degree in finance with the aim of attaining a masters in finance in the near future. 
I have over the last few weeks developed a fond appreciation for data and its importance in today's world. 
This is the primary reason for me seeking to pivot my career in a data inclusive direction because i feel they are a lot of opportunities for me there
