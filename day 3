The last project I worked on was a piece on music albums scored based on survey data. 
Most of the scores came from personalized opinions with a bit of objectivity in regards to cultural impact and production quality. 
Where I could improve on is obvious. I could stand to gain by creating a less arbitrary standard for more unbiased recording. 
However, I had fun with the whole project.
