Hey Hey. Today's challenge is to self evaluate. I guess im baring myself to the world now aren't I
I’d rate myself as strong in Excel, solid in SQL, and steadily growing in Python and BI tools. 
Excel is where I’m most confident — data cleaning, pivot tables, lookups, dashboards.
SQL is decent and functional: joins, aggregations, subqueries, and basic optimization are comfortable, but I know there’s another level in performance tuning and complex querying I’m working toward.
Python is still very nascent unfortunately, and I'm looking to further  my data manipulation and exploratory analysis.
My biggest execution gaps right now? Moving from analysis to storytelling faster, building more reproducible workflows, and being stricter about defining clean metrics before diving into the data.
