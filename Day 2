Hi everyone
Data is fun, but sometimes it can be a tad overwhelming.
Today I'm looking at data portfolis, how to build one and what makes a data portfolio a good one
Icl they are a lot of sweats out there, yeesh.
Their pages look so good omg
It is inspiring as well as daunting to think maybe I'll be at that level one day
One thing they all have in common is they apply the analysis trifecta
Which basically means technical proficiency, strategic thinking and *checks notes* communication skills. TOTALLY came up with that on my own btw
I can't wait till I actually start posting stuff I've been doing on here (teehee)
By for now chat
