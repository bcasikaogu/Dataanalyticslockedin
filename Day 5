As a growing data analyst, I’m focused on solving real business problems using structured data and clear insights. Here are five problems I could solve with data:

A retail company struggling to identify its most profitable products and sales trends.

A subscription-based business trying to understand and reduce customer churn.

A marketing team unsure which campaigns generate the highest return on investment.

A company that needs to optimize pricing to balance demand and profitability.

An organization facing inconsistent employee productivity across departments.
